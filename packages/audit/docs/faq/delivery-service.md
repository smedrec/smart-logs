# Delivery Service FAQ

Frequently asked questions about the Delivery Service implementation and usage.

## General Questions

### What is the Delivery Service?

The Delivery Service is a comprehensive system for delivering audit reports, exports, and other data to various destinations including webhooks, email, cloud storage, SFTP servers, and secure download links. It's designed with healthcare compliance in mind and provides robust retry logic, security features, and monitoring capabilities.

### What destinations are supported?

The service supports five destination types:

- **Webhooks**: HTTP/HTTPS endpoints with security features
- **Email**: SMTP and API-based providers (SendGrid, Resend, SES)
- **Storage**: Cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud) and local filesystem
- **SFTP**: Secure file transfer to SFTP servers
- **Download Links**: Time-limited, secure download URLs

### Is the service HIPAA compliant?

Yes, the service is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind:

- 7-year data retention policies
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Access controls and organizational isolation
- PHI handling with appropriate security measures

### Can I use multiple destinations for the same delivery?

Yes, the service supports multi-destination fanout. You can deliver the same payload to multiple destinations simultaneously, with independent retry logic and status tracking for each destination.

## Configuration and Setup

### How do I configure retry behavior?

Retry behavior is configurable at both the service and destination levels:

```typescript
const config = {
	retry: {
		maxAttempts: 5, // Maximum retry attempts
		baseDelay: 1000, // Initial delay in milliseconds
		maxDelay: 60000, // Maximum delay between retries
		jitterFactor: 0.1, // Random jitter to prevent thundering herd
	},
}
```

### What's the difference between circuit breaker states?

- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests are processed
- **Open**: Destination is failing, requests are blocked to prevent further damage
- **Half-Open**: Testing if the destination has recovered, limited requests allowed

### How do I set up webhook security?

Webhook security includes HMAC signatures, timestamps, and idempotency keys:

```typescript
const webhookConfig = {
	webhook: {
		url: 'https://api.example.com/webhook',
		security: {
			signatureHeader: 'X-Signature-SHA256',
			timestampHeader: 'X-Timestamp',
			idempotencyHeader: 'X-Idempotency-Key',
			requireSignature: true,
			requireTimestamp: true,
		},
	},
}
```

### Can I bring my own webhook secrets?

Yes, the service supports "Bring Your Own Secrets" (BYOS) configuration:

```typescript
const secretConfig = {
	enableBYOS: true,
	customSecret: 'your-predefined-secret',
}
```

## Performance and Scaling

### How many concurrent deliveries can the service handle?

The default configuration supports 10 concurrent deliveries, but this is configurable:

```typescript
const config = {
	queue: {
		concurrency: 25, // Process 25 deliveries simultaneously
		batchSize: 100, // Process in batches of 100
		processingTimeout: 120000, // 2 minutes timeout
	},
}
```

### How do I optimize for high-volume scenarios?

For high-volume processing:

1. Increase queue concurrency and batch size
2. Enable connection pooling
3. Use multiple service instances with load balancing
4. Optimize database connection pools
5. Implement proper caching strategies

### What's the maximum payload size?

There's no hard limit imposed by the service, but practical limits depend on:

- Destination type (email providers typically limit attachment sizes)
- Network timeouts
- Memory constraints
- Database storage limits

## Security and Compliance

### How are credentials stored securely?

Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption. The service supports:

- Environment variable configuration
- Encrypted database storage
- Integration with external secret management systems
- Automatic credential rotation

### What encryption is used for data in transit?

All external communications use TLS 1.2 or higher:

- HTTPS for webhooks
- TLS for SMTP connections
- SSL/TLS for SFTP connections
- HTTPS for cloud storage APIs

### How long are audit trails retained?

Audit trails are retained according to compliance requirements:

- HIPAA: 7 years (2,555 days)
- GDPR: Configurable, typically 1-7 years
- Custom: Configurable retention policies

### Can I restrict access by IP address?

Yes, for download link destinations:

```typescript
const downloadConfig = {
	download: {
		allowedIpRanges: ['10.0.0.0/8', '192.168.1.0/24'],
	},
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### What metrics are available?

The service provides comprehensive metrics:

- Delivery success/failure rates
- Processing latency and throughput
- Queue depth and processing times
- Circuit breaker states
- Destination health status
- Error rates by type and destination

### How do I set up alerting?

Alerting is built-in with configurable thresholds:

```typescript
const alertConfig = {
	failureRateThreshold: 10, // 10% failure rate
	consecutiveFailureThreshold: 5,
	queueBacklogThreshold: 1000,
	responseTimeThreshold: 30000, // 30 seconds
	debounceWindow: 300, // 5 minutes
}
```

### Is OpenTelemetry supported?

Yes, the service includes comprehensive OpenTelemetry integration:

- Distributed tracing for delivery workflows
- Custom metrics collection
- Span correlation across service boundaries
- Configurable sampling rates

### How do I debug delivery failures?

Use the built-in debugging tools:

```typescript
// Check delivery status
const status = await deliveryService.getDeliveryStatus(deliveryId)

// Test destination connectivity
const testResult = await connectionTester.testConnection(destination)

// Check destination health
const health = await deliveryService.getDestinationHealth(destinationId)

// Enable debug logging
const config = { logging: { level: 'debug' } }
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### What happens when a destination is down?

The service implements multiple protection mechanisms:

1. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures
3. **Health Monitoring**: Tracks destination status
4. **Fallback Destinations**: Alternative delivery paths
5. **Dead Letter Queue**: Handles permanently failed deliveries

### How do I recover from failures?

Recovery options include:

- Manual retry of failed deliveries
- Circuit breaker reset when destinations recover
- Bulk retry operations for multiple failures
- Alternative destination routing

### Can I cancel a delivery in progress?

Yes, deliveries can be cancelled if they haven't been processed yet:

```typescript
await deliveryScheduler.cancelDelivery(deliveryId)
```

### What's the dead letter queue?

The dead letter queue stores deliveries that have exhausted all retry attempts. These can be:

- Manually reviewed and retried
- Routed to alternative destinations
- Archived for compliance purposes

## Integration and Development

### How do I integrate with existing systems?

The service provides multiple integration points:

- REST API for programmatic access
- Event-driven architecture with webhooks
- Database integration with existing audit systems
- OpenTelemetry for observability integration

### Can I extend the service with custom destination types?

Yes, the service is designed for extensibility:

```typescript
class CustomDestinationHandler implements IDestinationHandler {
	readonly type = 'custom'

	validateConfig(config: DestinationConfig): ValidationResult {
		// Custom validation logic
	}

	async deliver(payload: DeliveryPayload, config: DestinationConfig): Promise<DeliveryResult> {
		// Custom delivery logic
	}
}
```

### How do I test my integration?

The service includes comprehensive testing utilities:

- Connection testing for all destination types
