await GDPRAuditService.logDataProcessing({
  principalId: 'nurse-456',
  dataSubjectId: 'patient-123',
  processingPurpose: 'medical_treatment',
  legalBasis: 'vital_interests',
  dataCategories: ['medical_history', 'current_symptoms'],
  retentionPeriod: 365
})
```

### What about other healthcare regulations?

The package is designed to support additional regulations:

- **21 CFR Part 11**: FDA electronic records requirements
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security and availability controls

- **State Privacy Laws**: California CPPA, Illinois BIPA, etc.

Custom compliance configurations can be implemented for specific regulatory requirements.

## üîí Security Questions

### How secure are the audit logs?

Audit logs use multiple security layers:

1. **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 for tamper detection
2. **Digital Signatures**: HMAC-SHA256 for authenticity
3. **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for data protection
4. **Key Management**: Integration with Infisical KMS
5. **Access Controls**: Role-based access to audit data

**Security verification example:**
```typescript
// Verify event integrity
const isIntact = auditService.verifyEventHash(event, expectedHash)
const isAuthentic = await auditService.verifyEventSignature(event, signature)

if (!isIntact || !isAuthentic) {
  // Handle potential tampering
  await handleSecurityIncident('audit_log_tampering')
}
```

### Can audit logs be tampered with?

The package provides strong tamper protection:

- **Immutable Hashes**: Each event has a cryptographic hash
- **Digital Signatures**: Events are signed with secret keys
- **Chain Verification**: Sequential hash verification available
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatic integrity checking
- **Breach Detection**: Immediate alerts on tampering attempts

However, security depends on proper implementation and key management.

### How are encryption keys managed?

The package supports multiple key management options:

1. **Infisical KMS**: Recommended for production environments
2. **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)**: For high-security requirements
3. **Environment Variables**: For development/testing
4. **Custom Key Providers**: Extensible key management interface

**Best practices:**
- Rotate keys every 30-90 days
- Use hardware-backed key storage in production
- Implement key escrow for compliance
- Monitor key access and usage

## ‚ö° Performance Questions

### How fast can it process events?

Performance depends on configuration and infrastructure:

- **Standard Setup**: 1,000-5,000 events/second
- **Optimized Configuration**: 10,000+ events/second
- **High-Performance Setup**: 50,000+ events/second

**Performance optimization example:**
```typescript
const highPerformanceConfig = {
  reliableProcessor: {
    batchSize: 500,           // Large batches
    concurrency: 20,          // Many workers
    enableBatching: true,     // Batch processing
    enableCircuitBreaker: true
  }
}
```

### Will audit logging slow down my application?

With proper configuration, audit logging has minimal impact:

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Events are queued, not blocking
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple events processed together
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation during issues

**Non-blocking implementation:**
```typescript
// This returns immediately, doesn't block application
await auditService.log({
  principalId: 'user-123',
  action: 'patient.view',
  status: 'success'
})
// Application continues without waiting for processing
```

### How much storage space is required?

Storage requirements vary by volume and retention:

- **Typical Event Size**: 1-5 KB per event
- **Daily Volume Example**: 100,000 events = ~500 MB/day
- **6-Year HIPAA Retention**: ~1 TB per 100k events/day
- **Compression**: 50-70% reduction with proper archival

**Storage optimization strategies:**
- Implement table partitioning
- Use data compression
- Archive old events to cold storage
- Implement tiered storage policies

## üîß Integration Questions

### How do I integrate with my existing EMR system?

Integration approaches depend on your EMR architecture:

1. **API Middleware**: Intercept API calls and add audit logging
2. **Database Triggers**: Audit database changes automatically
3. **Event Bus Integration**: Subscribe to application events
4. **Direct Integration**: Add audit calls to application code

**API middleware example:**
```typescript
// Express.js middleware for automatic auditing
app.use('/api/patients', auditMiddleware({
  auditPaths: [/\/api\/patients/],
  includeRequestBody: false,  // Don't log PHI in requests
  includeResponseBody: false
}))
```

### Can I use this with microservices?

Yes, the package is designed for microservices architectures:

- **Distributed Tracing**: Use correlation IDs across services
- **Centralized Logging**: Single audit database for all services
- **Service-Specific Queues**: Separate queues per service if needed
- **Cross-Service Events**: Track events across service boundaries

**Microservices configuration:**
```typescript
// Service A
await auditService.log({
  principalId: 'user-123',
  action: 'patient.lookup',
  correlationId: 'req-456',
  details: { sourceService: 'patient-service' }
})

// Service B (same correlation ID)
await auditService.log({
  principalId: 'user-123',
  action: 'billing.calculate',
  correlationId: 'req-456',
  details: { sourceService: 'billing-service' }
})
```

### What databases are supported?

The package primarily uses PostgreSQL but supports:

- **Primary**: PostgreSQL 12+ (recommended for healthcare)
- **Development**: SQLite (for testing and development)
- **Cloud**: AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database
- **Managed**: Supabase, PlanetScale (with PostgreSQL)

PostgreSQL is recommended for production healthcare environments due to:
- Superior compliance features
- Advanced partitioning capabilities
- Robust backup and recovery
- Extensive monitoring tools

## üö® Troubleshooting Questions

### Why are my events not showing up in the database?

Common causes and solutions:

1. **Queue Worker Issues:**
```typescript
// Check queue status
const stats = await auditService.getQueueStats()
console.log('Failed jobs:', stats.failed)
```

2. **Database Connection Problems:**
```typescript
// Test database connection
const result = await db.execute('SELECT 1')
```

3. **Validation Failures:**
```typescript
// Check event validation
const validation = validateAuditEvent(event)
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error('Validation errors:', validation.errors)
}
```

### How do I handle high-volume scenarios?

For high-volume environments:

1. **Enable Batch Processing:**
```typescript
const config = {
  reliableProcessor: {
    batchSize: 200,
    concurrency: 15,
    enableBatching: true
  }
}
```

2. **Optimize Database:**
```sql
-- Add performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_timestamp ON audit_log (timestamp DESC);
```

3. **Monitor Performance:**
```typescript
// Regular performance monitoring
const metrics = await auditService.getMetrics()
console.log('Processing latency:', metrics.processingLatency)
```

### What if audit logging fails?

Implement robust error handling:

1. **Graceful Degradation:**
```typescript
try {
  await auditService.log(event)
} catch (error) {
  // Log error but don't break application
  console.error('Audit logging failed:', error)
  // Implement fallback storage
  await fallbackAuditStorage.store(event)
}
```

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```typescript
const config = {
  reliableProcessor: {
    enableCircuitBreaker: true,
    circuitBreakerThreshold: 10
  }
}
```

3. **Dead Letter Queue:**
```typescript
// Failed events go to DLQ for manual review
const config = {
  reliableProcessor: {
    enableDLQ: true,
    dlqMaxRetries: 3
  }
}
```
