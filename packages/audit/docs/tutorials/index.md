## üìä Tutorial Progress Tracking

Track your progress through the tutorials:

- [ ] Basic Implementation - Standard audit setup
- [ ] Healthcare Compliance - HIPAA/GDPR configuration
- [ ] FHIR Integration - Healthcare data audit logging
- [ ] Security Configuration - Cryptographic security setup
- [ ] Monitoring & Observability - System monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Advanced Patterns - Multi-tenant and enterprise implementations

## üí° Tutorial Tips

### Best Practices
- **Start simple** and build complexity gradually
- **Test thoroughly** at each step before proceeding
- **Use realistic data** in your examples (but anonymized)

- **Document your configuration** for compliance auditing

### Common Pitfalls
- Skipping validation and error handling
- Not considering PHI data protection requirements
- Ignoring performance implications of high-volume auditing
- Insufficient monitoring and alerting setup
- Not planning for compliance reporting requirements
