- Error context preservation with detailed error information
- Proper error recovery strategies in retry mechanisms
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation for cascading failure prevention

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Inconsistent error propagation patterns across services
- Missing error correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Limited error sanitization for sensitive data exposure

## Implementation Gaps and Placeholders

### Critical Missing Implementations

#### 1. Core Service Method Bodies ($O(N)$ complexity impact)

**Location:** `src/services/`

- **Events Service:** Core CRUD operations partially implemented, streaming features incomplete
- **Compliance Service:** Interface-only implementation for HIPAA/GDPR reporting
- **Scheduled Reports Service:** Complete placeholder implementation
- **Presets Service:** Template system exists only as types
- **Metrics Service:** No actual metrics collection implementation
- **Health Service:** Basic health check missing operational readiness validation

#### 2. Infrastructure Component Gaps

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/`

- **Streaming Manager:** `ManagedReadableStream` class incomplete (lines 1-200 in streaming.ts)
- **Plugin System:** Plugin discovery and loading mechanisms not implemented
- **Batch Manager:** Request batching logic exists only as interface
- **Performance Monitor:** Metrics collection infrastructure missing

#### 3. Authentication Integration Points

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/auth.ts`

- **Token Refresh Logic:** Implemented but untested integration with real OAuth providers
- **Cookie Management:** Browser cookie integration incomplete for SSR scenarios
- **Custom Header Authentication:** Validation and security measures not implemented

#### 4. Real-time Features

**Location:** `src/services/events.ts` (lines 100-300)

- **WebSocket Connection Management:** `EventSubscriptionImpl` relies on unimplemented `StreamingManager`
- **Server-Sent Events:** Transport layer missing implementation
- **Connection Pooling:** Advanced connection management features placeholder

### Functionality Conceptually Required but Missing

#### 1. Data Validation and Sanitization ($O(1)$ per validation)

- **Input Sanitization:** XSS and injection attack prevention
- **Schema Evolution:** Backward compatibility handling for API changes
- **Data Encryption:** Field-level encryption for sensitive audit data

#### 2. Performance Optimization

- **Request Deduplication:** Preventing duplicate concurrent requests
- **Response Caching:** Intelligent cache invalidation strategies
- **Connection Pooling:** HTTP connection reuse optimization

#### 3. Observability Integration

- **Distributed Tracing:** OpenTelemetry integration hooks
- **Structured Logging:** Correlation ID propagation
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time performance metrics collection

## Logic and Design Flaws (Potential Bugs)

### 1. Race Conditions and Concurrency Issues

#### Token Refresh Race Condition ($O(N)$ concurrent requests)

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/auth.ts` (lines 200-250)

```typescript
// ISSUE: Multiple concurrent requests can trigger simultaneous token refresh
private refreshPromises: Map<string, Promise<TokenRefreshResult>> = new Map()
```

**Impact:** Token refresh requests may execute multiple times concurrently, causing API rate limiting
**Solution:** Implement proper request deduplication with mutex-like behavior

#### Circuit Breaker State Inconsistency

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/retry.ts` (lines 400-450)
**Issue:** Circuit breaker state transitions lack atomic operations, potentially causing inconsistent state in high-concurrency scenarios
**Risk Level:** **High** - Can lead to cascading failures

### 2. Memory Management Issues

#### Unbounded Cache Growth ($O(N)$ memory usage)

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/cache.ts` (lines 100-150)

```typescript
private cache = new Map<string, string>() // No size limiting in MemoryCache
```

**Issue:** MemoryCache implementation lacks proper LRU eviction, despite maxSize configuration
**Impact:** Potential memory leaks in long-running applications

#### Stream Buffer Accumulation

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/streaming.ts` (lines 150-200)
**Issue:** Stream buffers may accumulate indefinitely during backpressure scenarios
**Risk Level:** **Medium** - Memory exhaustion under high load

### 3. Data Integrity Violations

#### Configuration Merge Logic

**Location:** `src/core/config.ts` (lines 300-350)
**Issue:** Deep merge implementation doesn't handle circular references or complex nested objects properly
**Consequence:** Configuration corruption in edge cases

#### Event Correlation ID Collision

**Location:** Multiple service files
**Issue:** No collision detection for correlation IDs generated client-side
**Risk Level:** **Low** - Audit trail confusion in high-volume scenarios

## Performance and Efficiency Concerns

### 1. Algorithmic Complexity Issues

#### Configuration Validation ($O(N^2)$ for nested objects)

**Location:** `src/core/config.ts` - Zod schema validation
**Current Complexity:** $O(N^2)$ for deeply nested configuration objects
**Optimization:** Implement schema caching and incremental validation
**Impact:** Configuration updates become expensive with large config objects

#### Cache Key Generation ($O(N \log N)$ per request)

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/cache.ts` (lines 200-250)

```typescript
static forRequest(endpoint: string, method: string, params?: any, body?: any): string {
    // Object.keys().sort() creates O(N log N) complexity
    const sortedParams = Object.keys(params).sort()
}
```

**Optimization:** Pre-compute stable hash functions for common request patterns

#### Circuit Breaker Statistics ($O(N)$ cleanup per request)

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/retry.ts` (lines 480-520)
**Issue:** Statistics cleanup executes on every request, creating unnecessary overhead
**Recommendation:** Implement periodic cleanup with background timers

### 2. Data Structure Inefficiencies

#### Token Cache Lookup ($O(N)$ linear search)

**Current Implementation:** Map-based storage with string concatenation keys
**Optimization Strategy:** Implement hierarchical caching with prefix trees for $O(\log N)$ lookup

#### Event Handler Storage ($O(N)$ iteration)

**Location:** `src/services/events.ts` - EventSubscriptionImpl
**Issue:** Event handlers stored in Sets, requiring full iteration for cleanup
**Recommended:** Use WeakSet or indexed storage for $O(1)$ operations

### 3. Resource Management Inefficiencies

#### HTTP Connection Management

**Issue:** No connection pooling implementation, creating new connections per request
**Impact:** Network latency overhead of $O(100ms)$ per request for connection establishment
**Solution:** Implement HTTP/2 connection reuse with configurable pool sizes

#### Stream Processing Bottlenecks

**Location:** `src/infrastructure/streaming.ts`
**Issue:** Single-threaded stream processing without worker pool utilization
**Recommendation:** Implement worker-based stream processing for CPU-intensive operations
