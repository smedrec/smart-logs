## Publishing Process

### 1. Automated Publishing (Recommended)

#### Using GitHub Actions Release Workflow

1. **Trigger Release Workflow**:

   ```bash
   # Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí Audit Client Release ‚Üí Run workflow
   # Fill in the required information:
   # - Version: e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0
   # - Release Type: patch, minor, major, prerelease
   # - Prerelease: true/false
   ```

2. **Monitor Workflow**:
   - Watch the workflow execution in GitHub Actions
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Check that the package builds correctly
   - Ensure validation steps complete successfully

3. **Verify Publication**:
   - Check that the GitHub release is created
   - Verify the package appears on npm
   - Test installation from npm registry

#### Using CI/CD Pipeline

The package will be automatically published when:

- A GitHub release is created
- The release workflow completes successfully
- All validation checks pass

### 2. Manual Publishing

#### Step-by-Step Manual Process

1. **Prepare Release**:

   ```bash
   cd packages/audit-client

   # Update version
   npm version patch|minor|major

   # Update changelog
   # Edit CHANGELOG.md manually
   ```

2. **Validate Package**:

   ```bash
   # Run full validation
   pnpm validate:full

   # Test dry run
   pnpm release:dry
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore(audit-client): release vX.X.X"
   git tag vX.X.X
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

4. **Publish to npm**:

   ```bash
   # Login to npm (if not already logged in)
   npm login

   # Publish package
   pnpm release
   ```

5. **Create GitHub Release**:

   ```bash
   # Using GitHub CLI
   gh release create vX.X.X --generate-notes

   # Or create manually on GitHub web interface
   ```

## Post-Publishing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Verification

- [ ] Package appears on npm registry
- [ ] Package can be installed (`npm install @smedrec/audit-client`)
- [ ] Package works in test project
- [ ] Documentation site is updated
- [ ] GitHub release is created with proper notes

### üì¢ Communication

- [ ] Release announcement (if applicable)
- [ ] Update dependent projects
- [ ] Notify team members
- [ ] Update project documentation

### üìä Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor npm download statistics
- [ ] Watch for bug reports or issues
- [ ] Check community feedback
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Publishing Issues

#### Authentication Errors

```bash
# Check npm authentication
npm whoami

# Login if needed
npm login

# Verify access to package
npm access list packages
```

#### Version Conflicts

```bash
# Check existing versions
npm view @smedrec/audit-client versions --json

# Ensure version doesn't already exist
npm view @smedrec/audit-client@X.X.X
```

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
pnpm clean
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Check for TypeScript errors
pnpm check-types
```

#### Test Failures

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
pnpm test --reporter=verbose

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm test:environments
```

### Rollback Procedure

If a published version has critical issues:

#### Within 24 Hours (Unpublish)

```bash
# Unpublish the problematic version
npm unpublish @smedrec/audit-client@X.X.X

# Publish a fixed version
npm version patch
pnpm release
```

#### After 24 Hours (Deprecate)

```bash
# Deprecate the problematic version
npm deprecate @smedrec/audit-client@X.X.X "Critical issue - use vX.X.Y instead"

# Publish a fixed version
npm version patch
pnpm release
```

- [ ] Verify package ownership
- [ ] Check collaborator access
- [ ] Monitor security advisories

## Quality Gates

All of the following must pass before publishing:

1. **Automated Tests**: Unit, integration, and environment tests
2. **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation without errors
3. **Linting**: Code style and quality checks
4. **Build Validation**: Successful package build
5. **Package Validation**: Package structure and exports
6. **Security Audit**: No known vulnerabilities
7. **Documentation**: Up-to-date and accurate docs

## Support and Maintenance

### Version Support Policy
