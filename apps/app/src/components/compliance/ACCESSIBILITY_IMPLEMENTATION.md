## Usage Examples

### Keyboard Navigation:

```tsx
import { COMPLIANCE_SHORTCUTS, useKeyboardNavigation } from '../hooks'

const shortcuts = [
	{
		...COMPLIANCE_SHORTCUTS.CREATE_REPORT,
		action: () => createNewReport(),
	},
]

const { ref } = useKeyboardNavigation({ shortcuts })
```

### Screen Reader Support:

```tsx
import { generateAriaLabel, useAriaLiveAnnouncer } from '../utils'

const { announce } = useAriaLiveAnnouncer()

// Announce status changes
announce(`Report ${reportName} executed successfully`)

// Generate descriptive labels
const label = generateAriaLabel.reportStatus('completed', reportName)
```

### Responsive Design:

```tsx
import { useResponsive, ResponsiveGrid } from '../hooks'

const { isMobile, isTablet } = useResponsive()

<ResponsiveGrid columns={{ sm: 1, md: 2, lg: 3 }}>
  {reports.map(report => <ReportCard key={report.id} report={report} />)}
</ResponsiveGrid>
```

## Integration with Existing Components

All accessibility and responsive features integrate seamlessly with:

- ✅ Better Auth authentication

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ Lazy loading for non-critical accessibility features
- ✅ Debounced resize handlers for responsive hooks
- ✅ Memoized calculations for breakpoint detection
- ✅ Efficient ARIA live region management
- ✅ Minimal bundle size impact

## Browser Support

- ✅ Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- ✅ Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- ✅ Keyboard-only navigation
- ✅ Touch devices and tablets
