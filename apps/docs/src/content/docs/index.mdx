## Quick Start

Get up and running with Smart Logs in minutes:

```typescript
import { AuditClient } from '@smedrec/audit-client'

const client = new AuditClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.smartlogs.com',
  authentication: {
    type: 'apiKey',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
})

// Log a user login event
await client.events.create({
  action: 'user.login',
  principalId: 'user-123',
  organizationId: 'org-456',
  status: 'success',
  targetResourceType: 'User',
  sessionContext: {
    ipAddress: '198.51.100.10',
    userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...'
  }
})
```

## Architecture Overview

Smart Logs follows a modern microservices architecture:

- **Web/Native Apps**: React + TanStack Router, React Native + Expo
- **API Server**: Hono + tRPC + Better Auth + Drizzle ORM
- **Worker Service**: BullMQ + Redis for reliable background processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized partitioning strategies
- **Security**: End-to-end cryptographic verification and compliance validation

## Use Cases

- **Patient Data Access Logging**: Track who accessed patient records when and why
- **FHIR Resource Auditing**: Monitor changes to healthcare data standards
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate automated HIPAA and GDPR compliance reports
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect suspicious activities and unauthorized access
- **System Integration**: Audit API calls, data exchanges, and system interactions
