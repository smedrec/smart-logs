- React Native mobile app with Expo
- Real-time dashboard with WebSocket connections
- RESTful API for third-party integrations

#### 1.2 Core Service Components

**Audit Log Intelligence Engine**
- Real-time log processing and analysis
- Pattern recognition for compliance violations
- Automated risk scoring and alerting
- Historical trend analysis and reporting

**Compliance Automation Service**
