# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The audit client library serves as a comprehensive TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Server REST API (apps/server). This library will provide developers with a type-safe, feature-rich client that abstracts the complexity of direct API calls while offering advanced capabilities like retry mechanisms, authentication handling, caching, and comprehensive error management. The library must support all server API endpoints including audit events, compliance reporting, scheduled reports, audit presets, and system monitoring.

The client library will be designed for use in web applications, Node.js services, and other TypeScript/JavaScript environments, providing a consistent interface for all audit system operations while maintaining high performance and reliability standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive authentication support including API keys and session cookies, so that I can securely access the audit API from different types of applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API key authentication is used THEN the client SHALL automatically include the key in request headers
2. WHEN session-based authentication is used THEN the client SHALL handle cookies with credentials: 'include'
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the client SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
4. WHEN tokens expire THEN the client SHALL attempt automatic token refresh if configured
5. WHEN multiple authentication methods are available THEN the client SHALL support configuration of preferred method

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, so that my application can handle temporary network issues and server unavailability gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the client SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN retry attempts are configured THEN the client SHALL respect the maximum retry count
3. WHEN backoff timing is configured THEN the client SHALL use custom timing parameters

5. WHEN all retries are exhausted THEN the client SHALL return a comprehensive error with retry history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive audit event management capabilities, so that I can create, query, verify, and manage audit events through a simple programmatic interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating audit events THEN the client SHALL validate event data and submit to the server API
2. WHEN querying audit events THEN the client SHALL support filtering, pagination, and sorting options
3. WHEN retrieving specific events THEN the client SHALL provide methods to get events by ID
4. WHEN verifying event integrity THEN the client SHALL provide cryptographic verification methods
5. WHEN handling large result sets THEN the client SHALL support pagination and streaming responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive compliance reporting capabilities, so that I can generate HIPAA, GDPR, and custom compliance reports programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating HIPAA reports THEN the client SHALL provide methods with proper criteria validation
2. WHEN generating GDPR reports THEN the client SHALL support data export and pseudonymization requests
3. WHEN creating custom reports THEN the client SHALL allow flexible report criteria and formatting
4. WHEN reports are large THEN the client SHALL support streaming and chunked downloads
5. WHEN report generation fails THEN the client SHALL provide detailed error information and retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want scheduled report management capabilities, so that I can programmatically create, update, and manage automated reporting schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating scheduled reports THEN the client SHALL validate schedule configuration and report parameters
2. WHEN updating scheduled reports THEN the client SHALL support partial updates and validation
3. WHEN listing scheduled reports THEN the client SHALL provide filtering and pagination options
4. WHEN executing scheduled reports THEN the client SHALL provide immediate execution capabilities
5. WHEN managing report schedules THEN the client SHALL support CRUD operations with proper error handling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want audit preset management capabilities, so that I can programmatically manage audit configurations and templates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating audit presets THEN the client SHALL validate preset configuration and save to server
2. WHEN retrieving audit presets THEN the client SHALL provide methods to get presets by name or list all
3. WHEN updating audit presets THEN the client SHALL support partial updates with validation
4. WHEN deleting audit presets THEN the client SHALL provide confirmation and error handling
5. WHEN preset operations fail THEN the client SHALL provide detailed error messages and suggested fixes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling with detailed error information, so that I can properly handle and debug issues in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the client SHALL provide structured error objects with error codes and messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the client SHALL distinguish between different types of connectivity issues
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the client SHALL provide field-level error details
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN the client SHALL include request correlation IDs for debugging
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN the client SHALL provide configurable logging levels and formats

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimization features including caching and request batching, so that my applications can efficiently interact with the audit API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the client SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies
2. WHEN multiple similar requests are made THEN the client SHALL support request batching and deduplication
3. WHEN cache invalidation is needed THEN the client SHALL provide manual and automatic cache clearing
4. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN the client SHALL track request timing and success rates
5. WHEN bandwidth optimization is needed THEN the client SHALL support request compression and response streaming

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive system monitoring and health check capabilities, so that I can monitor the audit system status and performance from my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking system health THEN the client SHALL provide simple and detailed health check methods
2. WHEN monitoring system metrics THEN the client SHALL provide access to performance and usage statistics
3. WHEN tracking API usage THEN the client SHALL provide methods to retrieve usage metrics and quotas
4. WHEN system alerts are available THEN the client SHALL provide methods to retrieve and acknowledge alerts
5. WHEN monitoring integration is needed THEN the client SHALL support webhook and callback configurations
