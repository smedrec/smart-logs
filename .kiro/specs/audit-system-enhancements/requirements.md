# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The audit system is a critical transversal service that provides comprehensive audit logging, compliance tracking, and security monitoring across the entire SMEDREC healthcare platform. This system must be fully functional and compliant with healthcare regulations (HIPAA) and privacy laws (GDPR) before any other system components are implemented, as all services will depend on it for compliance and security requirements.

The current audit architecture includes three components: audit-db (PostgreSQL client), audit (Redis/BullMQ queuing), and audit worker (event processor). This specification focuses on enhancing these components to create a production-ready, compliant, and robust audit system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare system administrator, I want immutable audit logs with cryptographic integrity verification, so that I can ensure audit data hasn't been tampered with and meets regulatory compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audit event is stored THEN the system SHALL generate a cryptographic hash of the event data
2. WHEN audit logs are retrieved THEN the system SHALL verify the cryptographic integrity of each log entry
3. WHEN an audit log is created THEN the system SHALL prevent any modification or deletion of the log entry
4. IF cryptographic verification fails THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and log the integrity violation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit event tracking across all system operations, so that I can demonstrate regulatory compliance and investigate security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any CRUD operation occurs on patient data THEN the system SHALL create an audit event with complete context
2. WHEN user authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log login attempts, successes, failures, and logouts
3. WHEN system configuration changes occur THEN the system SHALL record the change details and responsible user
4. WHEN data access occurs THEN the system SHALL log who accessed what data and when
5. WHEN data export or sharing occurs THEN the system SHALL create detailed audit trails

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable audit event processing with guaranteed delivery, so that no audit events are lost even during system failures or high load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit events are queued THEN the system SHALL ensure persistent storage in Redis
2. WHEN the audit worker processes events THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms for failed processing
3. WHEN the audit worker is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue events until processing resumes
4. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. IF events cannot be processed after maximum retries THEN the system SHALL alert administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want GDPR-compliant audit logging with data portability and deletion capabilities, so that I can fulfill data subject rights while maintaining necessary audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a data subject requests their audit data THEN the system SHALL export all related audit logs in a portable format
2. WHEN a data subject requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL pseudonymize personal identifiers while preserving audit integrity
3. WHEN personal data is pseudonymized THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity for compliance investigations
4. WHEN audit data retention periods expire THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete logs according to policy

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want real-time audit monitoring and alerting capabilities, so that I can detect and respond to security incidents immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected in audit logs THEN the system SHALL generate real-time alerts
2. WHEN failed authentication attempts exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts
3. WHEN unauthorized data access attempts occur THEN the system SHALL immediately notify security teams
4. WHEN audit system components fail THEN the system SHALL send critical alerts to administrators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want standardized audit APIs and event schemas, so that all system components can consistently integrate audit logging without custom implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need to log audit events THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized API interface
2. WHEN audit events are created THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent event schema validation
3. WHEN different event types are logged THEN the system SHALL support extensible event schemas
4. WHEN services integrate audit logging THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive SDK documentation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want optimized audit data storage and retrieval performance, so that audit logging doesn't impact system performance while supporting compliance queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit events are stored THEN the system SHALL optimize database schema for write performance
2. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN the system SHALL support efficient querying with proper indexing
3. WHEN audit data grows large THEN the system SHALL implement data partitioning strategies
4. WHEN historical data is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide acceptable query response times

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability for the audit system, so that I can ensure system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit components are running THEN the system SHALL expose health check endpoints
2. WHEN audit events are processed THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for monitoring dashboards
3. WHEN errors occur in audit processing THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for troubleshooting
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide alerts with actionable information
