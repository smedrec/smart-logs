# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive delivery service within the audit package that enables reliable, configurable delivery of reports, data exports, and any exportable objects to multiple destination types. The system will provide enterprise-grade features including multi-destination fanout, automatic retries, failure handling, observability, and a management interface for configuration and monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple delivery destinations with different types (webhook, email, S3, etc.), so that audit reports and data exports can be automatically delivered to the appropriate systems and stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a delivery destination THEN the system SHALL support webhook, email, S3, SFTP, and database destination types
2. WHEN creating a destination THEN the system SHALL require authentication configuration appropriate to the destination type
3. WHEN saving a destination configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and authentication credentials
4. IF a destination configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific validation failures
5. WHEN a destination is created THEN the system SHALL assign it a unique identifier for referencing in delivery requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the delivery service, I want to send any exportable object to one or multiple destinations through a simple API, so that I can reliably deliver content without managing destination-specific logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a delivery request THEN the system SHALL accept any serializable object as payload
2. WHEN specifying destinations THEN the system SHALL support both single destination and multi-destination fanout delivery
3. WHEN no destinations are specified THEN the system SHALL use default destinations configured for the organization
4. WHEN a delivery is initiated THEN the system SHALL return a unique delivery identifier for tracking
5. WHEN delivering to multiple destinations THEN the system SHALL process each destination independently and not fail all deliveries if one destination fails

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed deliveries, so that temporary network issues or destination downtime don't result in lost deliveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a delivery fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry using exponential backoff starting at 1 second
2. WHEN retrying deliveries THEN the system SHALL implement a maximum of 5 retry attempts by default
3. WHEN the maximum retry count is reached THEN the system SHALL mark the delivery as permanently failed
4. WHEN a destination has consecutive failures THEN the system SHALL track the failure count and timestamps
5. IF a destination exceeds the failure threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically disable the destination and send alerts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a webhook receiver, I want to receive deliveries with standard webhook best practices including idempotency headers, timestamps, and cryptographic signatures, so that I can reliably process and verify incoming deliveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delivering via webhook THEN the system SHALL include an idempotency key header for duplicate detection
2. WHEN delivering via webhook THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp header with ISO 8601 format
3. WHEN webhook signatures are enabled THEN the system SHALL generate HMAC-SHA256 signatures using the configured secret
4. WHEN rotating webhook secrets THEN the system SHALL support gradual rotation with both old and new secrets valid during transition
5. WHEN "bring your own secrets" is configured THEN the system SHALL use customer-provided signing keys instead of system-generated ones

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a management interface to configure destinations, view delivery history, and manually retry failed deliveries, so that I can maintain operational visibility and control over the delivery system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the management interface THEN the system SHALL display all configured destinations with their status and health metrics
2. WHEN viewing delivery history THEN the system SHALL show delivery attempts, timestamps, status, and response details
3. WHEN a delivery has failed THEN the system SHALL provide a manual retry option through the interface
4. WHEN inspecting a delivery THEN the system SHALL display the full request payload, headers, and response details
5. WHEN filtering deliveries THEN the system SHALL support filtering by destination, status, time range, and organization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a multi-tenant platform operator, I want delivery destinations and history to be isolated by organization, so that each organization can only access and manage their own delivery configurations and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating destinations THEN the system SHALL associate them with the current organization context
2. WHEN listing destinations THEN the system SHALL only return destinations belonging to the current organization
3. WHEN viewing delivery history THEN the system SHALL only show deliveries for the current organization's destinations
4. WHEN performing delivery operations THEN the system SHALL validate organization access permissions
5. IF cross-organization access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the security event

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to receive alerts when destinations fail repeatedly and have destinations automatically disabled after excessive failures, so that I can maintain system health and prevent resource waste on consistently failing endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a destination fails THEN the system SHALL increment the failure counter and record the failure timestamp
2. WHEN failure count reaches the alert threshold THEN the system SHALL send notifications to configured alert channels
3. WHEN failure count exceeds the disable threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically disable the destination
4. WHEN sending failure alerts THEN the system SHALL implement debouncing to prevent alert spam
5. WHEN a disabled destination is manually re-enabled THEN the system SHALL reset the failure counter

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want comprehensive observability through OpenTelemetry metrics and traces, so that I can monitor delivery performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing deliveries THEN the system SHALL emit OpenTelemetry traces for the complete delivery lifecycle
2. WHEN deliveries complete THEN the system SHALL record metrics for success rate, latency, and throughput by destination type
3. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL emit error metrics with failure reason categorization
4. WHEN destinations are disabled THEN the system SHALL emit events for monitoring and alerting systems
5. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL emit warning metrics for proactive monitoring

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to reference deliveries across systems and view delivery status with deep linking capabilities, so that I can track delivery progress from external systems and provide users with detailed delivery information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a delivery is created THEN the system SHALL provide a globally unique reference identifier
2. WHEN querying delivery status THEN the system SHALL return current status, attempt history, and metadata
3. WHEN supported destinations provide tracking THEN the system SHALL include external tracking references in the response
4. WHEN deep linking is available THEN the system SHALL provide URLs for viewing detailed delivery information
5. WHEN cross-system integration is configured THEN the system SHALL support webhook callbacks for status updates

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible authentication flows for different destination types, so that I can securely connect to various external systems using their native authentication methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring webhook destinations THEN the system SHALL support API key, bearer token, and basic authentication
2. WHEN configuring cloud storage destinations THEN the system SHALL support IAM roles, access keys, and service account authentication
3. WHEN configuring email destinations THEN the system SHALL support SMTP authentication and OAuth2 flows
4. WHEN configuring database destinations THEN the system SHALL support connection strings and certificate-based authentication
5. WHEN authentication credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest using industry-standard encryption
