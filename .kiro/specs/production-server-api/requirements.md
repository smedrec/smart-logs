# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The production server application serves as the central API gateway for the SMEDREC healthcare platform, providing comprehensive access to all audit services through multiple API paradigms (TRPC, REST, and GraphQL). This server must be production-ready, containerized, and capable of handling high-throughput requests while maintaining security, compliance, and reliability standards required for healthcare applications.

The server integrates with the existing audit system packages (audit, audit-db, audit-sdk) and provides standardized APIs for web applications, mobile apps, and third-party integrations. It must support authentication, authorization, monitoring, and comprehensive error handling while being deployable in Docker containers for scalable production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a comprehensive TRPC API with type-safe procedures, so that I can build robust client applications with full TypeScript support and real-time type checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL expose TRPC endpoints at `/trpc/*` with full type safety
2. WHEN TRPC procedures are called THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters using Zod schemas
3. WHEN TRPC responses are returned THEN the system SHALL provide complete TypeScript type definitions
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN TRPC procedures SHALL enforce session validation
5. WHEN errors occur in TRPC procedures THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with proper error codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a third-party integrator, I want RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation, so that I can integrate with the audit system using standard HTTP methods and comprehensive API documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN REST endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL respond with proper HTTP status codes and JSON responses
2. WHEN API documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL serve OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. WHEN REST API authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support Bearer token authentication
4. WHEN REST API rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement configurable rate limiting
5. WHEN REST API versioning is required THEN the system SHALL support API version headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want GraphQL APIs with flexible querying capabilities, so that I can efficiently fetch exactly the data needed for mobile interfaces with minimal network requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL queries are executed THEN the system SHALL resolve data efficiently with proper field selection
2. WHEN GraphQL mutations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate input and return appropriate responses
3. WHEN GraphQL subscriptions are used THEN the system SHALL support real-time data updates
4. WHEN GraphQL introspection is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete schema information
5. WHEN GraphQL errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-level error details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the server to be fully containerized with Docker, so that I can deploy it consistently across different environments with proper configuration management and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is containerized THEN it SHALL build successfully with Docker and include all dependencies
2. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL support configuration through environment variables
3. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL perform health checks and readiness probes
4. WHEN deployed in production THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing
5. WHEN container logs are needed THEN the system SHALL output structured logs suitable for log aggregation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive authentication and authorization, so that I can ensure only authorized users can access audit data and system functions based on their roles and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL validate credentials using the Better Auth integration
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL verify session tokens and user permissions
3. WHEN role-based access is required THEN the system SHALL enforce RBAC policies for different API endpoints
4. WHEN audit operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log all authentication and authorization events
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses and log security events

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can track system performance, detect issues early, and maintain high availability in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL expose health check endpoints for monitoring systems
2. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for response times, error rates, and throughput
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with correlation IDs
4. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for CPU, memory, and database connections
5. WHEN alerts are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with alerting systems for critical issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an audit service consumer, I want comprehensive audit service APIs, so that I can access all audit functionality including event creation, querying, reporting, and compliance features through standardized interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit events need to be created THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for event submission with validation
2. WHEN audit logs need to be queried THEN the system SHALL provide efficient search and filtering capabilities
3. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for generating and retrieving reports
4. WHEN GDPR requests are made THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for data export and pseudonymization
5. WHEN audit integrity is verified THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for cryptographic verification

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized API performance with caching and connection pooling, so that the server can handle high-throughput requests efficiently while maintaining low latency for all API paradigms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling for optimal performance
2. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies
3. WHEN API responses are large THEN the system SHALL support pagination and streaming responses
4. WHEN concurrent requests are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking
5. WHEN performance bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL provide metrics to identify and resolve issues
