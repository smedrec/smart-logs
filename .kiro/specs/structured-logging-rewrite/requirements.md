# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for rewriting the `packages/logs` package to create a production-ready structured logging system. The current implementation has critical issues including type inconsistencies, async handling problems, performance bottlenecks, incomplete features, and naming inconsistencies that prevent safe production deployment. The rewrite will address these issues while maintaining the existing feature set and adding missing production-critical capabilities like proper batching, compression, and graceful shutdown.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Type Safety and Interface Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer using the logging library, I want consistent TypeScript interfaces and type safety so that I can rely on compile-time checks and avoid runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use any logger implementation THEN it SHALL implement a complete and consistent Logger interface
2. WHEN I call methods like `fatal` or `setRequestId` THEN the interface SHALL include these methods with proper type signatures
3. WHEN I configure the logging system THEN all configuration types SHALL be validated at runtime using Zod schemas
4. IF I use incorrect configuration values THEN the system SHALL fail early with clear error messages
5. WHEN I import logger types THEN there SHALL be no `any` or `Record<string, any>` types in public APIs

### Requirement 2: Async Operation Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable log delivery without unhandled promise rejections so that logs are not lost and the application remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs are sent to remote endpoints THEN all async operations SHALL be properly awaited
2. WHEN an async log operation fails THEN errors SHALL be caught and handled gracefully
3. WHEN the application shuts down THEN all pending log operations SHALL complete before exit
4. IF a log delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to a maximum number of attempts
5. WHEN multiple logs are processed concurrently THEN the system SHALL limit concurrency to prevent resource exhaustion

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer building high-throughput applications, I want efficient logging that doesn't impact application performance so that my application can handle production load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance logging is enabled THEN system metrics SHALL be sampled rather than collected per log
2. WHEN processing large log payloads THEN compression SHALL use streaming APIs to avoid blocking the event loop
3. WHEN generating correlation IDs THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure methods that avoid collisions
4. IF the log queue becomes full THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure or drop policies to prevent memory exhaustion
5. WHEN sending logs to remote endpoints THEN the system SHALL batch multiple logs to reduce network overhead

### Requirement 4: OTLP Export Implementation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want reliable OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) export functionality so that I can integrate with standard observability platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OTLP export THEN the naming SHALL be consistent (OTLP not OTPL) throughout the codebase
2. WHEN sending logs via OTLP THEN the payload format SHALL be correct without extra envelope wrapping
3. WHEN batching is enabled THEN logs SHALL be collected and sent in configurable batch sizes with timeout intervals
4. IF OTLP endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and circuit breaker pattern
5. WHEN compression is enabled THEN logs SHALL be compressed using gzip with proper Content-Encoding headers

### Requirement 5: Output Flexibility and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multiple output options (console, file, Redis, OTLP) that are fully implemented and production-ready so that I can choose the appropriate logging destination for my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using console output THEN logs SHALL be formatted appropriately for development and production environments
2. WHEN using file output THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation to prevent unbounded file growth
3. WHEN using Redis output THEN the system SHALL handle connection failures and implement reconnection logic
4. IF an output method is not implemented THEN the system SHALL throw clear errors rather than silently falling back
5. WHEN multiple outputs are configured THEN each SHALL operate independently without affecting others

### Requirement 6: Structured Logging Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want rich structured logging capabilities with proper correlation tracking so that I can effectively debug and monitor my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging request lifecycle events THEN correlation IDs SHALL be consistently tracked across all log entries
2. WHEN adding metadata to logs THEN the schema SHALL be validated and type-safe
3. WHEN logging database operations THEN performance metrics SHALL be captured automatically
4. IF security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity and structured fields
5. WHEN using different log levels THEN filtering SHALL work correctly based on configured minimum level

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized and validated configuration so that I can easily manage logging behavior across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing configuration THEN all options SHALL be validated using Zod schemas at startup
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
3. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be properly typed and validated
4. IF required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults or fail with clear messages
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading where safe

### Requirement 8: Graceful Shutdown and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper resource cleanup and log delivery guarantees so that no logs are lost during application shutdown.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application shuts down THEN all pending logs SHALL be flushed before exit
2. WHEN calling flush() THEN the system SHALL wait for all async operations to complete
3. WHEN resources need cleanup THEN file handles and network connections SHALL be properly closed
4. IF shutdown takes too long THEN the system SHALL timeout gracefully after a configurable period
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure to prevent out-of-memory errors

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling that doesn't crash my application so that logging failures don't impact core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log delivery fails THEN the error SHALL be handled gracefully without crashing the application
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns for remote endpoints
3. WHEN serialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other logs
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages for troubleshooting
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the logging library, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently make changes and ensure reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all core functionality SHALL have unit test coverage above 90%
2. WHEN testing async operations THEN race conditions and error scenarios SHALL be covered
3. WHEN testing serialization THEN edge cases and malformed data SHALL be handled properly
4. IF performance regressions occur THEN benchmark tests SHALL detect them
5. WHEN testing configuration THEN all validation scenarios SHALL be covered with clear assertions
