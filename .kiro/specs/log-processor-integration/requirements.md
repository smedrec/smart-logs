# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing the LogProcessor component that integrates multiple transports with the StructuredLogger. Currently, the StructuredLogger only outputs to console as a placeholder, but the transport implementations (Console, File, OTLP, Redis) exist and need to be properly integrated through a LogProcessor that can handle multiple transports simultaneously with proper error handling, batching, and configuration management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Transport Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure multiple log transports (console, file, OTLP, Redis) simultaneously so that I can send logs to different destinations based on my application needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure multiple transports THEN the LogProcessor SHALL send log entries to all enabled transports
2. WHEN one transport fails THEN other transports SHALL continue to function independently
3. WHEN I provide transport-specific configuration THEN each transport SHALL use its own settings
4. IF a transport is disabled in configuration THEN it SHALL not be initialized or used
5. WHEN I create a StructuredLogger with configuration THEN it SHALL automatically use the LogProcessor with configured transports

### Requirement 2: Configuration-Based Transport Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to pass complete configuration objects when creating a StructuredLogger so that I can avoid loading configuration from files and have full control over transport settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a StructuredLogger with a configuration object THEN it SHALL initialize all enabled transports
2. WHEN I provide transport-specific settings THEN each transport SHALL be configured with those settings
3. WHEN I omit optional transport configuration THEN sensible defaults SHALL be used
4. IF required configuration is missing for a transport THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN validation errors SHALL be thrown before logger creation

### Requirement 3: LogProcessor Implementation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a LogProcessor that manages multiple transports efficiently so that log processing is reliable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log entries are processed THEN the LogProcessor SHALL distribute them to all healthy transports
2. WHEN a transport becomes unhealthy THEN the LogProcessor SHALL skip it and continue with others
3. WHEN processing log entries THEN the LogProcessor SHALL handle async operations properly
4. IF all transports fail THEN the LogProcessor SHALL provide fallback logging to prevent data loss
5. WHEN the logger is closed THEN the LogProcessor SHALL properly close all transports

### Requirement 4: Transport Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want transport health monitoring so that I can detect and respond to logging infrastructure issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transport fails THEN its health status SHALL be updated to unhealthy
2. WHEN querying transport health THEN current status of all transports SHALL be available
3. WHEN a transport recovers THEN it SHALL be automatically re-enabled for log processing
4. IF transport health checks are configured THEN they SHALL run periodically
5. WHEN transport health changes THEN appropriate logging SHALL occur for monitoring

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer migrating from the old logging system, I want backward compatibility so that existing code continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the existing StructuredLogger interface THEN all methods SHALL work as expected
2. WHEN creating loggers without configuration THEN sensible defaults SHALL be applied
3. WHEN using legacy configuration formats THEN they SHALL be automatically converted
4. IF new features are used THEN they SHALL not break existing functionality
5. WHEN migrating existing code THEN minimal changes SHALL be required

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling in the logging system so that logging failures don't crash my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transport throws an error THEN it SHALL be caught and logged without affecting other transports
2. WHEN serialization fails THEN the error SHALL be handled gracefully with fallback representation
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN retry logic SHALL be applied where appropriate
4. IF all transports fail THEN emergency console logging SHALL be used as last resort
5. WHEN errors occur in logging THEN they SHALL not propagate to the application code

### Requirement 7: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer building high-performance applications, I want efficient log processing that doesn't impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing logs THEN transport operations SHALL be executed concurrently where possible
2. WHEN batching is enabled THEN logs SHALL be efficiently batched per transport
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN backpressure mechanisms SHALL prevent memory exhaustion
4. IF transport queues become full THEN appropriate overflow handling SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN logging overhead SHALL be minimal and measurable

### Requirement 8: Factory Pattern Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple factory pattern to create loggers with different configurations so that I can easily set up logging for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a logger factory THEN I SHALL be able to create loggers with predefined configurations
2. WHEN creating development loggers THEN console transport with pretty formatting SHALL be used
3. WHEN creating production loggers THEN appropriate transports for production SHALL be configured
4. IF custom configurations are needed THEN the factory SHALL accept configuration overrides
5. WHEN creating multiple loggers THEN they SHALL share transport instances where appropriate for efficiency

### Requirement 9: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the logging system, I want comprehensive integration tests so that I can ensure multi-transport functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN all transport combinations SHALL be tested
2. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN transport failures SHALL be simulated and handled correctly
3. WHEN testing configuration THEN various configuration combinations SHALL be validated
4. IF performance requirements exist THEN they SHALL be verified through automated tests
5. WHEN testing shutdown behavior THEN proper cleanup of all transports SHALL be verified

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Examples

**User Story:** As a developer using the logging library, I want clear documentation and examples so that I can quickly implement logging in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading documentation THEN clear examples of multi-transport setup SHALL be provided
2. WHEN configuring transports THEN all configuration options SHALL be documented
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN common problems and solutions SHALL be documented
4. IF advanced features are used THEN comprehensive examples SHALL be available
5. WHEN migrating from old versions THEN migration guides SHALL be provided
