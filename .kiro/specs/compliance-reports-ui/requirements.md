# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The compliance reports user interface provides a comprehensive web-based management system for healthcare compliance reporting within the SMEDREC platform. This interface enables compliance officers, administrators, and authorized users to create, manage, monitor, and analyze compliance reports including HIPAA, GDPR, and custom regulatory reports through an intuitive, accessible, and responsive web application.

The UI must integrate seamlessly with the existing audit client library, server APIs, and audit system while providing a modern, user-friendly experience built with React, TypeScript, shadcn-ui components, and Tailwind CSS. The interface should support all compliance reporting workflows from report creation to execution monitoring and result analysis.
