# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive alert management user interface for the apps/app application. The system will replace existing test routes with a production-ready interface that integrates with the Audit Client, server, and Client package. The interface will provide users with the ability to view, manage, and respond to alerts through a modern, accessible UI built with shadcn-ui and Tailwind CSS, maintaining consistency with the existing compliance reports interface.

5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and transform data appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the alert components to be modular and reusable, so that the codebase remains maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL organize them in the components directory structure
2. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL create small, focused components to avoid large code files
3. WHEN components are implemented THEN the system SHALL use shadcn-ui components as the foundation
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS classes consistently
5. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive code documentation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for the alert system, so that I can understand and maintain the implementation effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL explain component architecture and API integration
3. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL include inline comments and JSDoc annotations
4. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include setup and configuration instructions
5. WHEN the system is complete THEN the system SHALL include troubleshooting and maintenance guides

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an end user, I want clear documentation on how to use the alert management interface, so that I can effectively monitor and respond to system alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria
