# Feature Specification: Smart-logs SaaS Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-smart-logs`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The smart-logs project is a comprehensive audit and compliance logging system designed for regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA), security auditing, and operational observability, primarily in healthcare applications, but can be used by other businesses with similar compliance needs. We are developing the web application for the project's SaaS, in the apps/app directory. This application will help owners and administrators of each organization manage all aspects of the project. It will also be designed so that compliance professionals have access to all project compliance resources. Administrators will be able to configure all aspects of each organization: add staff and manage their permissions, create and update report templates, and create and update audit presets. Key features include an interactive event calendar to manage scheduled reporting, an alert management system, and compliance reporting interfaces designed for healthcare and regulatory environments such as HIPAA and GDPR."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Organization administrators and compliance professionals need a comprehensive web application to manage audit logging, compliance reporting, and organizational settings for healthcare organizations requiring GDPR and HIPAA compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an organization administrator logs into the system, **When** they access the organization management interface, **Then** they can view and modify all aspects of their organization including staff, permissions, and audit configurations
2. **Given** a compliance professional needs to generate reports, **When** they access the compliance reporting interface, **Then** they can create and customize reports that meet HIPAA and GDPR requirements
3. **Given** an administrator needs to schedule regular compliance activities, **When** they use the interactive event calendar, **Then** they can create, modify, and track scheduled reporting and audit activities
4. **Given** the system detects a compliance issue, **When** an alert is triggered, **Then** relevant staff members receive notifications through the alert management system

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an organization has multiple administrators with different permission levels?
- How does the system handle organizations with thousands of staff members?
- What occurs when a compliance report template is used across multiple organizations?
- How does the system manage audit presets that conflict with current organizational settings?
- What happens when scheduled reporting events overlap or conflict?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow organization administrators to add new staff members and assign appropriate permissions
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable administrators to modify existing staff permissions and roles
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide functionality for administrators to create new report templates
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow administrators to update and customize existing report templates
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable administrators to create and configure audit presets
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow administrators to modify existing audit presets
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide an interactive calendar interface for scheduling reporting activities
- **FR-008**: System MUST include an alert management system for notifying staff of compliance issues
- **FR-009**: System MUST offer compliance reporting interfaces specifically designed for healthcare regulatory requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all compliance reporting meets HIPAA standards

- **FR-012**: System MUST provide compliance professionals with access to all project compliance resources
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow organization owners to manage all aspects of their organization through the web interface

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_
