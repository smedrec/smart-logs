# Smart Logs Audit System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence

All code MUST maintain the highest quality standards with TypeScript strict type checking enabled. Every function, class, and interface MUST have TypeDoc-compatible JSDoc comments with parameter descriptions, return types, and examples. Code MUST pass ESLint configuration without warnings or errors. No unused variables, dead code, or TODO comments are permitted. Prettier formatting MUST be applied consistently across all files. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to these standards before approval.

### II. Comprehensive Testing Standards

All features MUST follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) with tests written before implementation. Unit tests MUST cover all pure functions and modules using Vitest framework. Integration tests MUST verify component interactions and API contracts. Contract tests MUST validate all API endpoints with proper request/response schemas. Test coverage MUST exceed 80% for all new code. Tests MUST include success paths, error handling, edge cases, and boundary conditions. All tests MUST run in CI/CD pipeline with failures blocking deployment.

### III. User Experience Consistency

All applications MUST maintain consistent UI patterns, navigation structures, and interaction models across web, mobile, and desktop platforms. Error handling and user feedback MUST be standardized with consistent messaging and behavior. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be maintained across all interfaces. Responsive design principles MUST ensure optimal experience across all device sizes. User interface components MUST follow established design system patterns and maintain visual consistency.

### IV. Performance Requirements

All API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms for 95th percentile under normal load. Database queries MUST be optimized with proper indexing and avoid N+1 problems. Memory usage MUST not exceed 100MB per service instance under normal operation. Caching strategies MUST be implemented for frequently accessed data. Load testing MUST validate performance under expected traffic patterns. Real-time monitoring and alerting MUST be configured for performance metrics. Circuit breakers and resilience patterns MUST prevent cascade failures.

### V. Documentation Standards

Every package and application MUST maintain comprehensive README files with current usage examples. Documentation MUST include getting started guides, tutorials, code examples for common use cases, troubleshooting guides, and FAQ sections. All code comments MUST be TypeDoc-compatible with parameter and return type documentation. API documentation MUST be auto-generated and kept current. Architecture decision records MUST document significant technical choices. When adding features or changing existing code, package/app README files MUST be updated in the same commit.

## Technical Standards

All development MUST use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. Turbo repo monorepo structure MUST be maintained with proper dependency management. Healthcare compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR) MUST be enforced through code review and testing. Security best practices including input validation, SQL injection prevention, and authentication/authorization MUST be consistently applied. Database schema changes MUST follow migration patterns with rollback capabilities.

## Development Workflow

All development MUST follow TDD with tests written before implementation. Code reviews MUST verify constitution compliance and testing coverage. Pull requests MUST include updated documentation and README changes. CI/CD pipeline MUST run full test suite and type checking before deployment. Performance testing MUST validate requirements before production deployment. Security scanning and compliance checks MUST be integrated into the deployment pipeline.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity introduced MUST be justified with clear documentation of necessity. The Testing Patterns and Practices document (TESTING.md) provides detailed implementation guidance for testing standards. Amendments require documentation of rationale, approval from technical leadership, and migration plan for existing code.
