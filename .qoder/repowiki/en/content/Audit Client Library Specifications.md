## Design Principles

The Audit Client Library is built on several core design principles that guide its architecture and implementation. These principles ensure the library is reliable, maintainable, and easy to use in various application contexts.

First, the library emphasizes type safety through comprehensive TypeScript support. All interfaces, configuration options, and API responses are strictly typed, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience through better tooling support and autocomplete functionality. This type safety extends to configuration validation using Zod schemas, which ensure that all configuration options are properly validated at runtime.

Second, the library follows a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components. This modularity allows for independent development and testing of different features while maintaining a cohesive interface. The separation of core functionality, services, infrastructure, and utilities enables developers to understand and extend the library more easily.

Third, the library prioritizes reliability through robust error handling and retry mechanisms. The client implements exponential backoff with configurable retry policies, circuit breakers, and comprehensive error management with correlation IDs for tracing. These features ensure that transient failures are handled gracefully and that applications can maintain functionality even under adverse network conditions.

Fourth, performance optimization is a key design consideration. The library includes request compression, streaming capabilities, and intelligent caching with multiple storage backends. These features reduce network overhead and improve response times, particularly in high-throughput scenarios.

Finally, the library emphasizes extensibility through its plugin architecture. This design allows developers to customize and extend the client's functionality without modifying the core codebase. The plugin system supports middleware, storage, and authentication extensions, enabling integration with various third-party services and custom business logic.
