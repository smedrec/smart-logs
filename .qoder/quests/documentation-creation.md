# @repo/audit Package Documentation Examples Design

## Overview

This design document outlines the creation of comprehensive documentation examples for the `@repo/audit` package, specifically focusing on the remaining TODO items identified in the README.md file. The examples will demonstrate practical implementation patterns for healthcare audit logging scenarios, covering FHIR workflows, authentication flows, batch processing, and integration patterns.

## Repository Type Detection

Based on the project structure analysis, this is a **Backend Framework/Library** system - specifically a comprehensive audit logging framework designed for healthcare applications with multiple specialized packages and full-stack application components.

## Architecture

The documentation structure follows a modular approach with four main example categories that need to be created:

## FHIR Workflows Documentation

### Patient Record Access Workflows

The FHIR workflows documentation will demonstrate comprehensive audit logging patterns for healthcare-specific FHIR resource interactions. This includes patient record access with proper PHI handling, clinical document management, medication orders, diagnostic reports, and appointment scheduling.

**Key Implementation Patterns**:

- FHIR R4 resource audit events with proper compartmentalization
- Patient compartment access tracking for privacy compliance
- Practitioner action logging with role-based validation
- Resource versioning and modification tracking
- Bundle operation audit trails for transaction integrity

**Compliance Integration**:

- HIPAA minimum necessary standard implementation
- GDPR consent management for EU patients
- Retention policy management for different resource types

- Backup and recovery operation tracking

## Integration Patterns Documentation

### Healthcare System Ecosystem Integration

The integration patterns documentation will provide examples for integrating the audit system with various healthcare systems, including EMR systems, laboratory information systems, pharmacy management systems, health information exchanges, and third-party API integrations.

**System Integration Approaches**:

- Message broker integration with HL7 FHIR messaging
- REST API integration with external healthcare systems
- Event-driven architecture with healthcare workflow engines
- Webhook integration for real-time audit notifications
- GraphQL integration for complex audit queries

**Data Flow Patterns**:

- Cross-system audit trail correlation
- Distributed transaction audit logging
- Event sourcing patterns for audit history
- CQRS implementation with audit projections
- Microservices audit aggregation strategies

## Healthcare Compliance Examples

### Regulatory Compliance Scenarios

Each example category will include specific compliance scenarios demonstrating:

**HIPAA Compliance Patterns**:

- Minimum necessary access logging
- Business associate audit requirements

## Implementation Priorities

### Documentation Creation Order

The examples will be created in the following priority order:

1. **FHIR Workflows** - Core healthcare functionality with highest compliance requirements
2. **Authentication Flows** - Security-critical patterns for access control
3. **Integration Patterns** - System interoperability for healthcare ecosystems
4. **Batch Processing** - Performance and scalability for enterprise deployments

Each example document will be comprehensive yet focused, providing practical implementation guidance while maintaining security and compliance best practices throughout all scenarios.
