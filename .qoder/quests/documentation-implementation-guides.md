# @repo/audit Package Implementation Guides Design

## Overview

This design outlines the comprehensive implementation guides needed to complete the documentation for the `@repo/audit` package. Based on the analysis of existing documentation and codebase, four critical implementation guides remain to be documented: Error Handling, Testing Strategies, Deployment Patterns, and Migration Guide.

These guides are essential for healthcare organizations implementing the audit system, providing practical implementation guidance for production environments with emphasis on reliability, compliance, and operational excellence.

## Repository Type Analysis

The `@repo/audit` package is a **Backend Framework/Library** specifically designed for healthcare audit logging. It provides:

- Core audit event processing infrastructure
- Healthcare compliance framework (HIPAA/GDPR)
- Cryptographic security services
- Database integration with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Reliable event processing with BullMQ
- Comprehensive testing framework

## Implementation Guides Architecture

### Error Handling Guide Structure

**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive error management strategies for production audit systems

**Core Components**:

    A[Error Detection] --> B[Error Classification]
    B --> C[Error Response Strategy]
    C --> D[Recovery Mechanisms]
    D --> E[Monitoring & Alerting]

    B --> F[Validation Errors]
    B --> G[System Errors]
    B --> H[Security Errors]
    B --> I[Compliance Errors]

    F --> J[Field Validation]
    F --> K[Schema Validation]
    F --> L[Sanitization Errors]

    G --> M[Database Errors]
    G --> N[Redis Errors]
    G --> O[Network Errors]
    G --> P[Queue Errors]

    H --> Q[Tamper Detection]
    H --> R[Signature Failures]
    H --> S[Encryption Errors]

    I --> T[HIPAA Violations]
    I --> U[GDPR Violations]
    I --> V[Retention Policy Errors]
```

**Error Classification Framework**:

| Error Category      | Severity | Recovery Strategy       | Monitoring Level |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Validation Errors   | Medium   | Sanitize and Retry      | Standard         |
| Database Connection | High     | Circuit Breaker + Retry | Critical         |
| Redis Failures      | High     | Graceful Degradation    | Critical         |
| Tamper Detection    | Critical | Immediate Alert + Stop  | Emergency        |
| HIPAA Violations    | Critical | Immediate Alert + Log   | Emergency        |
| Signature Failures  | Critical | Reject Event + Alert    | Emergency        |

**Error Response Patterns**:

- **Fail-Fast Pattern**: Immediate failure for critical security violations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation with reduced functionality
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Retry with Backoff**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Preserve failed events for manual review

**Implementation Patterns**:
